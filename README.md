# Proveit---2025
 Prove it is a 24-hour techathon dedicated to students passionate about technical fields, organized by BEST Ia»ôi.
 In this year's edition, putting our analytical thinking and technical skills to good use, we had to develop an efficient tuning algorithm for a dynamic system.
1. Description of the Challenge and Its Context: The challenge consists of developing control algorithms to maintain a constant speed (CC) and dynamically adjust speed based on the presence of a leading vehicle (ACC).

2. The tasks were:
 - Determination of the Fixed Part of the CC and ACC System, considering:
      * the mathematical model of (ii) the throttle valve based on the Bode Diagram from the provided slides. A reduced-order model approximation should be considered.
      * the mathematical model of (i) the longitudinal motion based on the given equations.
 - Design of a control method for Cruise Control (CC).
 - Design of two control methods for vehicle distance regulation in ACC.
 - Simulation of a scenario implementing the transition between ACC and CC modes for a "follower" vehicle.
 - Performance analysis based on overshoot, response time, rise time, and steady-state error.
